# [OKduck](https://es-k.github.io/OKduck/)

## The first ever duck-dating website!

This landing page (minus the ducks) is part of the foundations course in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

This is also my second attempt at html/css, following the [google homepage](https://github.com/es-k/google-homepage), which is also a part of TOP.

The [layout design](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) and [some colors and fonts](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png) were provided by the course. The ducks were my addition.
